    const {token} = useParams();//it returns the route prameter of  the url and from that we are destructuring it



  //first i will fwtch the loading state form my created slice called auth..why it is required??? as here we will call a function of service layer which will again make a request to the server by using the instance of axios so it is a network call and it may take time to give response .... so to depict that iur process is taking place we will run the spinner at that time
  //so we are taking loading so that when value of loading is true then we will show the spinner and when false we will show other things
  const { loading } = useSelector((state) => {
    return state.auth;

  //then we will create  state variables such as resetPasswordDone which will be initialy false and when password will get  reset then it will be true

    // and also we will pass the new password which user entered in the form
     dispatch(resetPassword(formData.password,formData.confirmPassword,token,setresetPasswordDone,setemail));
